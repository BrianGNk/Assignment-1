## Hello Octocat
I love Octocat. She's the coolest cat in town.

```{r quick_look, echo=TRUE}

```{r xy_plot, echo=FALSE, fig.height= 8, fig.width= 8, fig.align='center', dev= 'svg', fig.path= '.figures/'}

##Assignment 4
```{r data_import, echo=TRUE}
## Analgesic
rm("anscombe")
library(readr)
df <- read_csv("analgesic.csv")

```

```{r data_summary, echo=TRUE}

#Column names

#The fist and last six lines

```

```{r data_tidy, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyr) # to tidy data
df2 <- gather(df, methods, pain_scores, Measurement_1:Measurement_3)
library(dplyr) # to manipulate data
df2 %>%
  group_by(ID) %>%
  summarise(avg = mean(pain_scores))

```


##Assignment 5
```{r , echo=TRUE}

## Chick Weights

# Null hypothesis (Ho)
# Ho = feed type has no significant effects on chick weight
# Alternative hypothesis (H1)
# H1 = feed type significantly affects chick weigh

# If the p-value < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis
# for lack of confusion remove df
rm("df")
library(readr) # Activating readr package to read data file

# read data an assign to df3
df3 <- read.csv("chick-weights.csv")

# Statistical summary of data
summary(df3)

# Plot chick~weights data
boxplot(df3$weight ~ df3$feed, xlab = "Feed Type", ylab = "Weight")

# Testing Data Normality, and homoscedasticity
# Normality using Shapiro.test
shapiro.test(df3$weight)
# p-value = 0.21, does not deviate from normality. Therefore it is normally distributed
# Homoscedasticity using Bartlett's test
bartlett.test(df3$weight ~ df3$feed, data = df3)
# p-value = 0.66 greater than 0.05, asssume homoscedasticity
# Data qualifies for use of ANOVA to test data differences


# Statistical test
# Assign result of ANOVA to anovaresult1
anovaresult1 <- aov(weight ~ feed, data = df3)
summary(anovaresult1)
# For clean graphical presentation of significance
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(anovaresult1)
# Taking Pr(>F) of 5.94e-10 and plot of ANOVA results into account shows that feedtype significantly affects chick weight

# Inorder to determine which of the different types of feed was most effective pairwise.t.test was implimented using "holm" method

# Parwise post-hoc test
posthoc <- pairwise.t.test(df3$weight, df3$feed,
                p.adjust.method = 'holm',
                paired = FALSE)
#data shows that soybean on average has a p-value = 0.003 < than 0.05
#eject null hypothesis thus meaning feed type positively affects chicken weights.
```

## Gastroenteritis

# Null hypothesis (Ho)
# Ho = There is no relationship between water consumption frequency and occurance of illness

# Alternative hypothesis (H1)
# H1 = There is a significant relationship between water consumption frequency and occurance of illness

# X-squared = 74.925, df = 2, p-value < 2.2e-16

## Nausea

rm(gastro)

# Null Hypothesis (Ho)
# Ho = administration of 5HT3-receptor blocker does not increase nausea intensity in breast cancer patients

## Assignment 6

## Houses

# Ho = House prices are independant of interest rates

# Alternative hypothesis (H1)
